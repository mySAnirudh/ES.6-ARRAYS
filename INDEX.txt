   >>> An JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store
    different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of 
    elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages 
    where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array
     is a single variable that stores multiple elements.
    

    The use of variables to store values poses the following limitations:
 Variables are scalar in nature. In other words, a variable declaration can only 
contain a single at a time. This means that to store n values in a program, n
variable declarations will be needed. Hence, the use of variables is not feasible 
when one needs to store a larger collection of values. 
 Variables in a program are allocated memory in random order, thereby making it 
difficult to retrieve/read the values in the order of their declaration.
JavaScript introduces the concept of arrays to tackle the same.
An array is a homogenous collection of values. To simplify, an array is a collection of values 
of the same data type. It is a user-defined type. 
Features of anArray
 An array declaration allocates sequential memory blocks.
 Arrays are static. This means that an array once initialized cannot be resized.
 Each memory block represents an array element.
 Array elements are identified by a unique integer called as the subscript/index of 
the element.
 Arrays too, like variables, should be declared before they are used.
 Array initialization refers to populating the array elements. 
 Array element values can be updated or modified but cannot be deleted. 
Declaring and Initializing Arrays
To declare and initialize an array in JavaScript use the following syntax:
var array_name; //declaration
array_name=[val1,val2,valn..] //initialization
OR
var array_name=[val1,val2…valn]
Note: The pair of [] is called the dimension of the array.
